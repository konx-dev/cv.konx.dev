Working with modern standardisations such as CSS Grid and current ECMAScript.</p><p>Day to day I use Nuxt.js but also keen on exploring other JavaScript frameworks such as Next.js (React) for SSG and SSR. As JavaScript can be utilised on both the front and backend, I am working on side projects to have a working knowledge of the full stack with node based content management systems such as Strapi.</p>"

Photoshop for anything pixel based and image editing. InDesign for editorial and layout.</p><p>For prototyping / wireframing I use Figma. With the latter, I've found the ability to share my designs and receive live feedback through just a web browser requiring no software besides a browser on the clients end creates a frictionless experience for feedback.</p>"
